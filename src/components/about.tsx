        Welcome to my website. I initially created this website originally to learn some HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        I also wanted to try learning React.js so this website became my side project to become familiar with it.
        At the top are links to other pages like the software projects I have worked on, a link to my Github page,
        and a link to my Jailbreak Repo.</p>
